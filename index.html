        <h4>What is Web Coding?</h4>
        <p>
          It is the process of writing and designing code that is used to create
          and maintain websites or web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several key technologies and languages commonly used in web
          coding:
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language
          used to create the structure of web pages. It defines elements such as
          headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used for styling HTML elements
          and controlling the layout of web pages. It allows developers to
          define the visual presentation of a website, including aspects like
          colors, fonts, and spacing.
        </p>

        <h4>Coding Daily, Coding All Time! Never Give Up!</h4>
        <p>
          Remember, the key is consistency and perseverance. Learning to code is
          a gradual process, and progress may not always be linear. Celebrate
          small victories, and don't be afraid to seek help when you encounter
          challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cultivate a curious mindset. Stay updated on new technologies,
          programming languages, and industry trends. This curiosity will keep
          your learning journey exciting and relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take advantage of online platforms, coding tutorials, and courses.
          Websites like Codecademy, Khan Academy, freeCodeCamp, and Coursera
          offer excellent resources for learning to code.
